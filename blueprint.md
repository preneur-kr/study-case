# Lotto Number Generator

## Overview

A simple, visually appealing web application to generate random lottery numbers. The application will feature a button to generate the numbers and a display area for the results, incorporating modern design principles for a clean and engaging user experience.

## Current Plan

1.  **HTML Structure (`index.html`):**
    *   Set up the basic HTML document structure.
    *   Add a main title for the application.
    *   Include a button with the text "Generate Numbers".
    *   Create a `div` container to display the generated lottery numbers.
    *   Link the `style.css` and `main.js` files.

2.  **Styling (`style.css`):**
    *   Apply a clean and modern design to the page.
    *   Style the "Generate Numbers" button to be interactive and visually appealing.
    *   Design the number display area to present the generated numbers clearly, possibly with some animation.
    *   Ensure the layout is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

3.  **Functionality (`main.js`):**
    *   Add a click event listener to the "Generate Numbers" button.
    *   Implement a function to generate 6 unique random numbers between 1 and 45.
    *   Display the generated numbers in the designated container.
    *   (Optional) Add a simple animation for the numbers appearing on the screen.
